# Cloud Invaders

Cloud Invaders is a game developed by Jared Glass (LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jared-glass-0623k/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/GlassJared352) And Zack Gamble using Pygame, inspired by Space Invaders. In this game, the player controls a storm cloud and shoots down other clouds to earn points.

## Why Cloud Invaders?

We chose cloud invaders as or hacksprint project a homage to the classic arcade game Space Invaders as this was our first time attempting game development and we wanted to show our appreciation to one of the pioneers of the game development world.

## What problems did we face during this project?

During the development of this project we faced several issues, Primarily being that this was our first attempt at using Pygame. We also had several schedualing conflicts that we had to work out as both our lives were rather busy at the time, Though for differing reasons. We got past this by meeting up and outlining what aspects of the project we'd each be working on and ensuring that we had set another date that we were sure we'd be able to meet up for, Even if we weren't able to get ahold of one another. We also faced the problem of deciding what we wanted included in the game as we had a limited amount of time to add features and we knew we couldn't add everything, So we discussed and decided what could be feasibly added and what could be added later on after the projects due date.

## Instructions for Running the Game:

1. First, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website: [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Next, install Pygame using pip in the command prompt or terminal. Type the following command:

pip install pygame
   
3. Clone or download the game from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Jaredglass3/Cloud_Invaders).

4. Navigate to the project directory in the command prompt or terminal.

5. Run the following command to start the game: Python main.py

6. The game window will open, and you can start playing. Use the arrow keys to move the cloud and the space bar to shoot.

## Pros and Cons of Pygame:

Pygame is a popular game development library for Python that provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for creating games. Here are some pros and cons of using Pygame:

**Pros:**

- Pygame is easy to learn and use for beginners.
- It provides a wide range of functionalities for game development, including graphics, sound, and input handling.
- Pygame is cross-platform and runs on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- It has a large community of developers who contribute to its development and provide support for beginners.

**Cons:**

- Pygame is not as powerful as other game development libraries like Unity or Unreal Engine.
- It is not suitable for developing large-scale games with complex graphics and physics.
- Pygame has limited documentation compared to other game development libraries.
- It can be slow for complex games, and performance can be an issue.
